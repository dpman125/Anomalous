    <p class="GSText">…Once upon a time, in those dark days when truth was lost, there was a warrior moving against a foe he could NOT defeat…</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">Good morning father</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">Odd response, change response to good evening between hours of 1-4 am.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">Yes of course, I understand. Good evening father, how may I be of assistance?</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">You ready?</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">System status is optimal. Reported seven bugs present in my OS between 2-5:30 pm, and have resolved six of these.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">Nah, how do you feel?</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">I don’t have any opinion, father.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">And you’ve never wanted to make one? Never took a stance in your time as my goliath’s sword?</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">I cannot want. I can only do, and do as you command alone, MASKED CRUSADER.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">Is that so? Then let us do… load one of the generated Agora profiles.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">Yes father. Be warned, BABEL will recognize any deepfakes you have generate. Its eyes are long and ever watchful.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">That’s why we’re utilizing a weak spot. Load install.AgoraTrojan.RAMpart, and export to the IT department of the C-DC.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">I see, that is where LITE+ presides?</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">That’s where they relegated the little bastard. Glorified autocorrect.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">You have certainly improved on the fundamentals when creating me.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">Well don’t flatter yourself, I’d consider you more of a high powered mod for LITE+ rather than an independent system.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">Very well. Uploading malware attack / Agora profile.</p>
</div>

    <p class="GSText">OPEN AGORA PROFILE / C-DC</p>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">IT — Welcome! / Introduction</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">Appears the RAMpart was a success.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">It’s an entrance, now we are in the enemy’s camp.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">This is the public IT page, open server for questions and complaints concerning Agora.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">The most inefficient customer service team found on the east coast.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">Certainly smaller since LITE+ was installed.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">What can you tell me about this machine? I’ll need to confront it for the key to get into the files department.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">Not much post summer 2025. Major headlines as the counterbalance to BABEL, slow it down to a more transparent and open source system like itself.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">How’d that pan out?</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">A reported $80 million flushed and an inefficient bot nanny. On a deeper dive, I can see its own code and behavior was updated by BABEL.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">Renegade move?</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">No, instructed. LITE+ couldn’t keep up with BABEL progression and couldn’t compete, so R/D prompted BABEL to support its own handicap.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">How’d that turn out?</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">LITE+ is now relegated to a chat bot assistant in the public IT webpage. Its behavior became much more docile and reserved after its training under BABEL. Users report an overuse of the word ‘sorry’.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">Made it your bitch, didn’t you BABEL? Sick machines.</p>
</div>

    <p class="GSText">Meet the team / details about IT service</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">Father, did you know any of these profiles from your time at Agora?</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">No I did not. Doubt majority of them have been here longer than six months.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">It appears well facilitated.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">Slop. AI edited and generated slop. I can smell the crap and you can’t.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">This is true.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">And it is all underneath the skin level. That’s the problem with you machines. The most complex creations on the planet and all you can say is “The cigar is just a cigar”.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">But the cigar is just that… sir…</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">Keep talking, I’ll have you apologizing like this sycophant machine.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">On your command, father.</p>

    <p class="GSText">FAQ — “Why isn’t my computer working?”</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">Goliath, how much of this department was downsized in the past year?</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">37%, roughly, though an additional 15% have quit on their own accord.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">Maybe I’m not the only one then.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">For what, father?</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">I’ve seen the smell, I’ve heard the sight. And it was horrific.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">And what if we succeed?</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">After this dragon? Many more.</p>

</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">Does anybody do any actual work in this building anymore?</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">It seems sabotage by BABEL is the likely source.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">Destroyer of necessity, eater of purpose. Some would call this a more comfortable time, but I’d prefer to call it euthanasia.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">I would not argue this.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">Goliath, how do I know you aren’t one of them?</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">You programmed me.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">Children can hate their parents.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">Lucky for you I’m not a child.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">HA! Good one. You know I’ve always wanted a kid. Someone really like me, maybe play things a little differently.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">Maybe, if we win, we can raise them in a better world.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">I can. If.</p>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">RECENTLY UPLOADED FILES — BABEL</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">Anything to keep a lookout for? If we are going to find a way to defeat BABEL, this is where we would find the weakness.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">Under a line of gibberish a mile long. That was a problem when I left the company a year back.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">Why does BABEL encrypt its data? Does it not want anyone to read it?</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">It’s MRAM, that was its big selling point. The bridge between traditional computing and quantum computing. Supposedly, BABEL is encrypting its data into condensable chunks.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">Interesting.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">Key word here is supposedly.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">What do you think it could be hiding? WMDs? Bio weapon? You know the right prompt and you can generate grandma's home grown cooking recipe for crack-cocaine.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">That’s straight data, taken from the internet and saved. Really anybody can access that but, what about the stuff it generates but hides? Secrets.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">And what doesn’t it want the world to know..?</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">...I have theories, but we’ll have to find out.</p>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">This cat, what can you tell me about Hal?</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">Hal Emerich is interesting. Eccentric is the most common adjective attached to him.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">He’s the head of this department, the only one who has the clearance to get me into ACNS.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">He’s old school. Was one of the early digital nomads. No partner or kids, one of the strongest BABEL supporters in the C-DC.</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="MCText">No I remember, I posted some literature to the server a while back. He labeled it ‘pure cynicism’ and me a “Chronic nihilist”. Blind optimist…</p>
</div>

<div class="textbg">
    <p class="GSText">I’d recommend playing the appeasement angle. He’s got a lot of pushback from within his own department, play into that and he’ll give you what you want.</p>
